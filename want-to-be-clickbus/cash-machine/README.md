Cash Machine

The Problem
================

Develop a solution that simulate the delivery of notes when a client does a withdraw in a cash machine.

The basic requirements are the follow:

* Always deliver the lowest number of possible notes;
* It's possible to get the amount requested with available notes; * The client balance is infinite; Saldo do cliente Ã© infinito;
* Amount of notes is infinite;
* Available notes R$ 100,00; R$ 50,00; R$ 20,00 e R$ 10,00

Example:
================
*
 **Entry:** 30.00
 **Result:** [20.00, 10.00]

*
  **Entry:** 80.00
  **Result:** [50.00, 20.00, 10.00]

*
  **Entry:** 125.00
  **Result:** *throw NoteUnavailableException*

*
 **Entry:** -130.00
 **Result:** *throw InvalidArgumentException*

*
  **Entry:** NULL
  **Result:** [Empty Set]
